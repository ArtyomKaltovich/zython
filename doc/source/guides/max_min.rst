Optimizing some value (Minimize/Maximize Objective)
===================================================

Minizinc supports three ways of solving model: satisfy, minimize and maximize some values.
Before we've seen example of satisfying problem - solver should find any solution, that satisfies every constraint.
In this chapter we will solve minimization and maximization problem - solver should find solution,
that not only satisfies every constraint, but also produce the smallest(or biggest) cost value.
